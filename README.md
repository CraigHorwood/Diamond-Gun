# Diamond Gun

This game was made in Java over the course of three months of on/off procrastination while also working on another, larger game project that never saw the light of day. Looking at the source code today, it's clear that I was learning a lot about programming in Java, and programming in general, while making the game, so sometimes it looks like several different people with different code ideals worked on the game at the same time.
